## Installation

Fisrt make sure you have the following files in the same directory:
* Makefile : For automated compilation

* driver.cpp : Has main method with a switch statement that performs a certain task when a particular option is selected. 

* Tags.cpp : Has the logic of the whole program. It has different functions that are to be called in deriver.cpp file when a certain option is selected.

* Tags.h : Has structure and all function definations used in the program

* *.txt: These are the files used for testing. If tags are nested, include 'nested' in the file name e.g long_nested.txt.

To compile and run the the program:
```
$ make
$ make run

```
Enter one of the options and hit "Enter":

* r : reads the file (Note: will have to enter file name after hiting "Enter")
* p : outputs the different tags <TAG> to the terminal
* d : outputs the tag data to a file "tag,txt"
* l : output tag data to terminal -> Tag name: x , Tag count: y , Tag text: z 
* q : closes the program
